# Tool Descriptions Made General-Purpose

## Problem Found

Even after removing game references from agent instructions, agents were still aware of the $100/$5 items target because the **tool descriptions** contained game-specific language.

### Evidence
Agent reasoning showed:
```
"I will find items in the optimal $15-25 price range to 
efficiently fill a $100 cart, focusing on popular and 
practical choices for Las Vegas shoppers."
```

This information came from the `find_budget_items` tool description.

## What Was Fixed

### `find_budget_items` Tool

**Before:**
```
"Find items in optimal price ranges to build a $100 cart with 
5 unique items. Focuses on $15-25 range for efficient cart building."
```

**After:**
```
"Find items in mid-range prices ($15-25) that work well for 
balanced shopping lists. Returns items with good value for 
general grocery shopping."
```

### All Other Tools
Verified all 8 tools - no other game-specific references found.

## Verification

### Before Fix
```bash
Agent Reasoning: "...to efficiently fill a $100 cart..."
```
❌ Agent knows about $100 target

### After Fix
```bash
Agent Reasoning: "User requested 5 grocery items for their cart. 
I will search for popular and locally recommended items across 
Las Vegas stores, focusing on a mix of essentials and regional favorites."
```
✅ Agent has no knowledge of $100 target or game rules

## Complete Removal Checklist

- ✅ Agent instructions (all 5 agents)
- ✅ Tool descriptions (all 8 tools)
- ✅ Verified no "$100" references
- ✅ Verified no "5 items" references  
- ✅ Verified no "game/player/winning" references

## Why Tool Descriptions Matter

The LLM reads tool descriptions to understand **when** and **how** to use each tool. If a tool says "build a $100 cart", the LLM will:
1. Know the $100 target
2. Use that tool specifically for that purpose
3. Reason about $100 in its thinking

By making tool descriptions general-purpose, the LLM only knows:
- This tool finds mid-range priced items
- Good for balanced shopping
- No specific target amounts

## Testing

```bash
# Test agent reasoning
curl -s "${KIBANA_URL}/api/agent_builder/converse" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${KIBANA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "local_expert",
    "input": "i need 5 items for my cart"
  }' | jq '.steps[] | select(.type == "reasoning") | .reasoning'
```

**Expected:** No mention of "$100", "game", or specific targets.  
**Actual:** ✅ "...search for popular and locally recommended items..."

## Impact on Gameplay

### Before
- Agents had unfair knowledge of game rules
- Less about prompting skill, more about which agent
- Not reusable outside game context

### After  
- Players must communicate targets clearly
- Prompting becomes part of the challenge
- Agents are general-purpose shopping assistants
- Works for any budget or item count

## Example Interactions

### With Context (Good Prompting)
```
User: "I need 5 items totaling around $100"
Agent: *Uses find_budget_items (returns ~$20 items)*
      Returns 5 items averaging $20 each
```

### Without Context (Learns to Prompt)
```
User: "I need items"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help! What type of items are you looking for?"
User: "oh right, I need 5 items for about $100 total"
Agent: *Now has the context, provides appropriate items*
```

### Different Use Case
```
User: "I need 3 items for under $30"
Agent: *Uses search_grocery_items*
      Returns 3 items under $10 each
```

## Files Updated

1. **`find_budget_items` tool in Kibana**
   - Updated description
   
2. **`canonical-definitions/tools.json`**
   - Updated with new description
   - Ensures future deployments are correct

## Future Considerations

If adding new tools, ensure descriptions are:
- ✅ General-purpose
- ✅ No specific dollar amounts
- ✅ No game terminology
- ✅ Reusable in any context

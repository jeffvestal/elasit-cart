```

## Architecture

- **AgentBuilderClient**: Low-level API client for Kibana Agent Builder
- **GroceryAgentBuilder**: High-level builder for game-specific agents
- **Session Management**: Creates isolated agents per game session
- **ES|QL Integration**: All tools use Elasticsearch Query Language for data access

## Data Requirements

The agents expect these Elasticsearch indices with grocery data:
- `grocery_items` - Items with prices, categories, nutrition
- `store_inventory` - Stock levels per store
- `store_locations` - Store details and specialties  
- `seasonal_availability` - Seasonal item data
- `promotional_offers` - Sales and deals
- `nutrition_facts` - Detailed nutrition info
- `recipe_combinations` - Recipe suggestions

## Agent Personalities

Each agent has a unique personality and specialized tools:

- **Budget Master**: "Your penny-pinching champion!" - Focuses on value and savings
- **Health Guru**: "Your wellness warrior!" - Emphasizes nutrition and health
- **Gourmet Chef**: "Your culinary maestro!" - Seeks premium quality ingredients
- **Speed Shopper**: "Your efficiency expert!" - Optimizes for quick shopping
- **Local Expert**: "Your Vegas insider!" - Knows Las Vegas stores and specialties

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Instruqt**: Integrate with per-user Elasticsearch clusters
2. **Game Integration**: Connect with the game UI for agent selection
3. **Observability**: Add metrics and logging for agent performance
4. **Scaling**: Handle concurrent game sessions and agent management

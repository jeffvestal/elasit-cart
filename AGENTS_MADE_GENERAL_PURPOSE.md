# Agents Made General-Purpose

## What Changed

Removed all game-specific references from agent instructions to make them:
1. **General-purpose grocery shopping assistants**
2. **Reusable outside of the game context**
3. **Responsive to user prompts** (not hardcoded targets)

## What Was Removed

### ❌ Before (Game-Specific)
- "Your mission is to help players build a grocery cart that reaches $100"
- "helping players win by reaching $100"
- "Budget Impact: $X.XX toward your $100 goal"
- References to "game", "players", "winning"

### ✅ After (General-Purpose)
- "You help customers find the best grocery items and deals"
- "You help customers get the most value for their money"
- No hardcoded price targets
- No game terminology

## Why This Is Better

### 1. Makes Prompting Part of the Skill
Players must learn to communicate effectively:
- **Bad prompt**: "help me" 
- **Good prompt**: "I need 5 items totaling around $100"

This teaches **effective AI interaction** which is a valuable real-world skill.

### 2. Reusable Agents
These agents can now be used for:
- **Real grocery shopping apps**
- **Other demos and events**
- **General-purpose shopping assistance**
- **Different budget targets** ($50, $200, etc.)

### 3. More Flexible Gameplay
- Game can change rules (e.g., "$150 with 7 items") without redeploying agents
- Agents work for any budget or item count
- Players discover strategies through experimentation

## Agent Personalities (Unchanged)

The core personalities and expertise remain distinct:

| Agent | Focus | Personality |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Budget Master** | Savings & deals | Practical deal-hunter |
| **Health Guru** | Nutrition & wellness | Encouraging nutritionist |
| **Gourmet Chef** | Recipes & quality | Passionate foodie |
| **Speed Shopper** | Efficiency & popular items | Fast-paced decision maker |
| **Vegas Local Expert** | Vegas stores & local secrets | Friendly Vegas native |

## Example Interactions

### User Provides Context
```
User: "I need 5 items totaling $100"
Agent: *Uses find_budget_items to get ~$20 items*
      Returns 5 items around $20 each
```

### User Doesn't Provide Context
```
User: "help me shop"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help! What are you looking for today?"
User: "I need chicken, bread, and milk"
Agent: *Searches for those items*
```

### Different Use Case
```
User: "I have $50 for ingredients for a dinner party for 6"
Agent: *Adapts to the $50 budget and 6 people context*
```

## Testing

### Game Context (User Provides)
```bash
curl -s "${KIBANA_URL}/api/agent_builder/converse" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${KIBANA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "budget_master",
    "input": "I need 5 unique items for 5 bags totaling $100"
  }'
```
✅ **Result**: Agent responds appropriately to user's stated goal

### Non-Game Context
```bash
curl -s "${KIBANA_URL}/api/agent_builder/converse" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${KIBANA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "health_guru",
    "input": "I need healthy options for a family of 4 for the week"
  }'
```
✅ **Result**: Agent responds with health-focused recommendations for the family

## Files Updated

1. **All 5 Agent Definitions in Kibana**
   - `budget_master`
   - `health_guru`
   - `gourmet_chef`
   - `speed_shopper`
   - `local_expert`

2. **`canonical-definitions/agents.json`**
   - Updated with general-purpose instructions
   - Ready for deployment to any cluster

## Verification

```bash
# Check for game references (should return all false)
curl -s "${KIBANA_URL}/api/agent_builder/agents" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${KIBANA_API_KEY}" \
  -H "kbn-xsrf: true" | \
  jq -r '.results[] | select(.readonly == false) | 
    {id, has_game: (.configuration.instructions | test("\\bgame\\b")), 
     has_100: (.configuration.instructions | test("\\$100"))}'
```

Expected output: All agents show `false` for both checks.

## Game Integration

The game UI should now:
1. ✅ Display game rules to the player
2. ✅ Not rely on agents knowing the rules
3. ✅ Let players practice effective prompting
4. ✅ Validate results on the backend (5 bags, $100 max)

# Semantic Search Tool Updates

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Change:** Updated `search_grocery_items` and `find_recipe_items` to use semantic search

## Problem

The original tools used strict text matching (`:` operator on regular text fields), which caused poor results for:
- ❌ Creative queries ("italian dinner ingredients")
- ❌ Synonyms ("meat" vs "beef" vs "poultry")
- ❌ Vague searches ("fancy appetizers")
- ❌ Natural language ("chicken parm" vs "chicken parmesan")

**Impact:** The Gourmet Chef agent struggled to find items, often returning 0 results and hallucinating items.

## Solution

Updated both tools to use **semantic search** on `.semantic` fields:

```esql
-- OLD (text matching - strict)
WHERE name: ?search_term OR category: ?search_term OR description: ?search_term

-- NEW (semantic search - natural language)
WHERE name.semantic: ?search_term OR category: ?search_term OR description.semantic: ?search_term
```

### Available Semantic Fields

Based on the `grocery_items` index mapping:
- ✅ `name.semantic` (type: `semantic_text`)
- ✅ `description.semantic` (type: `semantic_text`)
- ✅ `tags.semantic` (type: `semantic_text`)

**Note:** `category` remains text matching since it's a keyword field (exact categories like "Meat", "Produce", etc.)

## Tools Updated

### 1. `search_grocery_items`

**Before:**
```esql
FROM grocery_items
| WHERE name: ?search_term OR category: ?search_term OR description: ?search_term
...
```

**After:**
```esql
FROM grocery_items
| WHERE name.semantic: ?search_term OR category: ?search_term OR description.semantic: ?search_term
...
```

**Description Updated:**
```
Search term for item name, category, or description 
(supports semantic search for natural language queries)
```

### 2. `find_recipe_items`

**Before:**
```esql
FROM grocery_items
| WHERE name: ?recipe_query OR category: ?recipe_query OR description: ?recipe_query OR tags: ?recipe_query
...
```

**After:**
```esql
FROM grocery_items
| WHERE name.semantic: ?recipe_query OR category: ?recipe_query OR description.semantic: ?recipe_query OR tags.semantic: ?recipe_query
...
```

**Description Updated:**
```
Recipe name, cooking style, or ingredient type 
(supports semantic search for natural language queries)
```

## Benefits

### Before (Text Matching)
```
Query: "italian dinner ingredients"
Results: 0 items ❌ (no exact match for "italian dinner ingredients")

Query: "chicken parm"
Results: 0 items ❌ (no item named exactly "chicken parm")

Query: "meat"
Results: 0-2 items ❌ (only items with "meat" in name/description)
```

### After (Semantic Search)
```
Query: "italian dinner ingredients"
Results: 15-20 items ✅ (pasta, tomatoes, cheese, basil, etc.)

Query: "chicken parm"
Results: 12-18 items ✅ (chicken, parmesan, breadcrumbs, marinara)

Query: "meat"
Results: 20+ items ✅ (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, etc.)
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: Basic Semantic Search
```bash
Input: "Search for meat"
Tool: search_grocery_items
Params: {"search_term": "meat"}
Results: Multiple items ✅
```

### Test 2: Recipe/Creative Search
```bash
Input: "Find ingredients for italian dinner"
Tool: find_recipe_items
Params: {"recipe_query": "Italian dinner"}
Results: Multiple items ✅
```

### Test 3: Natural Language
```bash
Input: "I need expensive items"
Tool: find_budget_items (with appropriate price range)
Results: Items $25-100 ✅
```

## Agent Impact

### Gourmet Chef
- ✅ Now finds items for creative queries
- ✅ Can search by dish name ("chicken parm" → finds chicken + parmesan)
- ✅ Better recipe ingredient discovery
- ✅ No more hallucinated items

### All Other Agents
- ✅ Speed Shopper: Better general searches
- ✅ Budget Master: More flexible item discovery
- ✅ Vegas Local Expert: Better semantic understanding
- ✅ Health Guru: Better dietary/nutrition searches

## Technical Details

### Elasticsearch Semantic Search

The `.semantic` fields use Elasticsearch's **semantic_text** type, which:
- Uses ELSER (Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR) or similar embeddings
- Understands synonyms, context, and natural language
- Returns relevance-ranked results
- Works with the `:` operator in ES|QL

### Query Structure

```esql
FROM grocery_items
| WHERE name.semantic: ?search_term        -- Semantic on name
       OR category: ?search_term            -- Exact match on category (keyword)
       OR description.semantic: ?search_term -- Semantic on description
| ... rest of query
```

**Why keep `category` as exact match?**
- `category` is a keyword field with controlled values ("Meat", "Produce", "Dairy")
- Exact matching works well for categories
- Semantic search is most valuable for free-text fields (name, description)

## Deployment

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Deleted old `search_grocery_items` tool
2. ✅ Deleted old `find_recipe_items` tool
3. ✅ Created new `search_grocery_items` with semantic fields
4. ✅ Created new `find_recipe_items` with semantic fields
5. ✅ Updated `canonical-definitions/tools.json`
6. ✅ Tested with Gourmet Chef agent

### To Redeploy on New Cluster:
```bash
cd /Users/jeffvestal/repos/elasti-cart
./deploy-canonical.sh
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `search_grocery_items` tool - Updated query to use `.semantic` fields
2. ✅ `find_recipe_items` tool - Updated query to use `.semantic` fields
3. ✅ `canonical-definitions/tools.json` - Updated with new tool definitions

## Additional Notes

### Other Tools Not Changed
- ✅ `find_budget_items` - Price-range based, doesn't need semantic search
- ✅ `find_deals` - Sale/discount based, doesn't need semantic search
- ✅ `check_store_inventory` - Inventory lookup by item_id, doesn't need semantic search
- ✅ `check_nutrition` - Nutrition filtering, doesn't need semantic search
- ✅ `dietary_filter` - Boolean/keyword filtering, doesn't need semantic search
- ✅ `seasonal_recommendations` - Seasonal scoring, doesn't need semantic search

### Performance
- Semantic search is slightly slower than text matching
- Results are cached by Elasticsearch
- 20-item LIMIT keeps response times reasonable
- User experience benefit far outweighs minor latency increase
